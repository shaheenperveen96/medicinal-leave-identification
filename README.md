Step 1: collected two datasets named “medicinal leaf dataset” and “medicinal leaf dataseat”.Merged them into one dataset.
Step 2: Done data visualization and found that the data was imbalanced.
Step 3: pre-processed the data split the dataset into 80:20 ratio in the train and validation set. Created and run models on the dataset.
Step 4: Applied upsampling on the training dataset.
Step 5: Run models on the upsampled dataset and changed the hyperparameters to get high accuracy and saved the model to use it further.
Step 6: Create a UI and a dataset in CSV format which contains the local name and the scientific name of a particular leaf and also the medicinal use of that leaf.
